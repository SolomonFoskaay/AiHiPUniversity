### üõÇ Course Prerequisites

Prerequisites for taking this course:

**(1)** [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download?ref=AiHiPUniversity.com "Nodejs Website")

Lets check if you have it already

Open your terminal and run this command `node -v` if it return something like `v18.4.0` hurray you have nodejs installed and you can move to next tool. 

If it shows error or nothing, then you need to install latest LTS version)

**(2)** [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation?ref=AiHiPUniversity.com "PNPM Website") Node package manager preferable over NPM and YARN (Install if not having it yet)

**(3)** Essential Basic knowledge of:
  
- Using CLI

- Git/Github

- IDE/Code Editor like Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

- Svelte/Sveltekit (frontend)

- ExpressJs (backend)

- Web Hosting & Domain Hosting

**(4)** Optional Basic knowledge of:

- Openai large language AI models and their API

- Vercel (frontend hosting)

- Render (backend hosting)

### üë∑ Recommended OS

Recommended OS (Operating System) to follow this course are:

- Linux (This is the one I used for this course, precisely Ubuntu distro)
- MacOS
- Windows (You may need to setup and use Linux Sub-System to avoid issues when using Windows OS for development)

### üë∑ DEMO: ChatGPT Clone AI ChatBot Demo

This is what you will be able to build and ship at the end of this course. A ChatGPT human-like conversational AI chatbot of your own as seen in this demo below:

[Foskaay Coding AI](https://Foskaay.AiHiPUniversity.com?ref=AiHiPUniversity.com "Foskaay AI For Coding Website") (the demo might reflect a more advanced version to what this course cover by the time you will be checking it in future. Don't worry, i will also be releasing another course to cover the upgrades done to it. So, ask in our discord to be pointed to the new)

### ‚úÖ Intro To AiHiPUniversity Platform

i. Artificial Intelligence + Human Intelligence + Programming = AiHiPUniversity

ii. Free courses from Beginner, intermediate to Advanced courses for Pro developers.

iii. Ai 24/7 support to enhance developer productivity

iv. Support for students in their programming journey

v. Access to community of like-mind developers across the World.

vi. Web3/Blockchain development courses

vii. Free certification (Exercises, Challenges  and Final Project is a must to receive certification).

## üëΩÔ∏è Recomended - CODING AI Support Tools

In my daily programming tasks, projects and throughout this course, I used combination of 2(two) or more coding AI to enhance my productivity as a programmer and recommend you try them out to 10x your programming skill and productivity too.

This is my own opinion from personal experience and doesn't mean the only AIs to help you as programmer (Infact you can suggest me any other one you are currently using via our discord server and if tested okay, may include it in this list for students to use.).

Also, if you develop one, you can become a sponsor of this free course platform and your programming AI will be added as well.

### üëΩÔ∏è FREE- CODING AI Support Tools

**(1)** [Foskaay](https://Foskaay.AiHiPUniversity.com?ref=AiHiPUniversity.com "Foskaay AI For Coding Website") (Our AiHiPUniversity Official Programmers Coding Support AI called `Foskaay` Coding AI - Still in development and need your suggestion for features to add + funding support to release for production use by programmers)

**(2)** [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com?ref=AiHiPUniversity.com "Foskaay AI Website") (Openai's general purpose AI chatbot with support for coding. But, now most times unrelable due to frequently going over-capacity in handling huge influx of users - Infact I tried it just while writing this and it dening me access - I think its important for Foskaay coding AI to move to production soon if well funded)

### üëΩÔ∏è FREE+PREMIUM- CODING AI Support Tools

**(1)** [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot?ref=AiHiPUniversity.com "Foskaay AI Website") (Official GitHub's coding support AI)

**(2)** [Codex](https://beta.openai.com/playground?model=code-davinci-002?ref=AiHiPUniversity.com "Foskaay AI Website") (Openai's coding AI, though with less capacity in my own opinion to ChatGPT & Text-Davinci-003 which is what you will use to build your AI chatbot in this course and currently using to testrun our own coding support AI Foskaay. I added it to Freemium because you are using your Openai API credit each time you use it and if you exhuast the free initial $18 giving, you will have to upgrade to paid AI API plan of Openai to continue to access it.)

## üìù Become A Successful Developer Tips

Master essential attitudes to become a lifetime successful developer:

i. Embrace Ai like Foskaay Ai for coding and programming support always (before, during and after launching your project)

ii. Security (Ai can help discover and patch security flaws in your project early before and during launching)

iii. Start every project with Git Private (start with Opensource as beginner dev, close source only when become pro dev if essential for funding & IP protection). And, consistently commit your work to Git platforms like GitHub everytime you do a minor changes (like installing a node package) or major changes (like delete or re-ording your project file structure).

iv. Code Commenting

v. Simplicity wins over complication/complexity (functions getting complex, break to simpler ones)

vi. Leave local host quicker for Production Deployment and testing.

vii. Listen to your project users feedbacks and tinker adjustment fast bit-by-bit

viii. Keep the programming spirit high and alive by doing good to humanity and nature with your coding/progamming skill and not evil.

### üìå Course Target Audience

#### i. üë∑ Who Is This Course For?

- Intermediate and
- Advanced Developers

#### ii. üìà What You Will Learn In This Course?

i. At the end of this course, students should have a solid understanding of how to build a chatbot website like chatGPT using Svelte/Sveltekit and the OpenAI API.

ii. Students will also be able to design and implement an interactive user interface, make API calls and handle responses

		15. Messages/chat conversation scrollbar when get to a long lenght
         as desired by the developer.

		16. Secure API endpoint from frontend user access/discovery 
			via web browser tool like Network and console  

    17. Unique chat id for each chat conversation appended to the url automatically 
        (I used a UUID node package to generate the unique IDs randomly each time
         new chat is initialized with the #Create New Chat" button )  
		
		
#### üîä PENDING FEATURES

		1. Join our discord and send your desired features. Also, 
			use issues to suggest improvements.

		2. User can edit old and current chat instance title label as desired

		3. Initially, the chat label title gets auto renamed 
			based on user first query/question asked the AI.

		9. Chat can save on both local and remote storage

		10. Code highlighting with prism or highlightjs when responding with code

		11. Search feature: user quick searches chat history by particular 
			keyword(s) can bind search to url with sveltekit search node package

		12. User can click to scroll down or up the page with right floating up 
			and down arrows

		13. Use NFT to unlock the AI chatBot app (Web3 integration)

		14. Some modern user experience features you could 
			add to your AI chatbot include:

			i. Conversational context: keep track of the conversation's context to
			 		understand the user's intent, for example: 
				The user had been asking about the weather and the next query
					 if the user says "what about tomorrow", 
				Your chatbot should be able to understand that the user is still 
					asking about the weather.
				Here is a sample code snippet that you can use to implement
				 context in your Chatbot:

				Copy code
				// A context object to keep track of conversation context
				let context = {};

				// Update the context object based on the user's message
				function updateContext(message) {
				// Assume the user is asking for the weather
				context.topic = 'weather';
				// Extract the location from the message
				const locationRegex = /(?:in|for|near|at) ([\w\s]+)/i;
				const match = message.match(locationRegex);
				if (match) {
				context.location = match[1];
				}
				}

				// use this on your onSubmit function before calling the api
				updateContext(message);

				// pass context object on the fetch request to save context
				const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000', {
				method: 'POST',
				headers: {
					'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				}, 
				body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: message, context }),
				});                

			ii. Multimodal input: support different ways of receiving user input,
				 for example: voice, text, and touch.

			iii. Adaptive learning: allow the chatbot to learn from user
			 	interactions and improve over time.

			iv. Personalization: allow the user to set preferences and personalize
				 the experience, for example: the chatbot could greet the user
				  by name and ask how they're doing.

			v. Multi-Language support: allow the user to switch between 
				different languages.

### üìö 4. Planning project folder structure

Planning project folder structure (Backend server and frontend)

	1. -Root Folder (name: ai-chatbot-app)
	
		1. -server (Backend: ExpressJs)
			i. server.js
			ii. package.json
			iii. .env
			iv. whitelist.js
		
		2. -ui (Frontend: Svelte/Sveltkit)
			i. src
			ii. package.json
			iii. other sveltekit folder
		
		3. -.gitignore (block sensitive files like .env from been pushed to GitHub)
		
		4. -README.md (about the project)

### üìö 5. Deciding web development techstack to use

You need to decide the techstack to use based on your AI chatbot features including features you like to adapt from chatGPT.

For this course, I used the following techstack to build the AI chatbot:

**(1)** Express.js for Backend (server)

**(2)** SvelteKit for Frontend (ui)

**(3)** Openai's GTP-3 API for AI chatbot responses

### üìö Exercise 1

Plan and design the chatbot interface and layout. Submit screenshot in your course exercise repo.

#### üçª Challenge 1

Research and apply best practices for building an AI Chatbot.

## üé® Lesson 2: Setup Project with Git

You need to first setup the project on GitHub (this might be contrary to what you are used to doing as a developer. Yeah, I want to help you adopt the good habit of consistently commiting your work to Git server like GitHub).

Incase anything happens to your PC during your project development phase, you are sure of having a backup to recover your project on GitHub.

### üé® 1. Create Project in Git using Github

Create an empty folder on GitHub named ai-chatbot-app.

**NOTE:**

i. Don't initialize it with README.md file, just leave empty.

ii. You can also make it Private repo and later turn it to public repo under the repo setting page when your AI chatbot app is ready for deployment on web server.

### üé® 2. Clone GitHub Repo to PC

Clone the empty folder from GitHub to your PC.

Open your terminal and inside the folder you want the project to be, run:

```javascript
    git clone the-url-of-your-github-repo-here
```

Then, run:

```javascript
      cd ai-chatbot-app
```

Once sure that you are in the cloned repo folder (../course-demo/ai-chatbot-app), run:

```javascript
      code .
```      

This will open the cloned empty ai-chatbot-app folder in VSCode editor.

That is where we will be bringing our app to life step by step.

### üé® 3. Setting up Project Folder in IDE(VSCode)

Setting up Project Folder in IDE/Code Editor (VSCode)

If everything goes fine, you should have an empty ai-chatbot-app folder now opened in VSCode editor.

It is time to begin creating essential folders and files for the app.

Before setting up the server folder which is the next thing to do. Lets quickly setup two (2) important files in the empty root folder ../ai-chatbot-app as follows:

1. Create a .gitignore file with following content:

```js
# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
pnpm-debug.log*
lerna-debug.log*

node_modules
dist
dist-ssr
*.local

# Editor directories and files
.vscode/*
!.vscode/extensions.json
.idea
.DS_Store
*.suo
*.ntvs*
*.njsproj
*.sln
*.sw?

# env
.env

# others:
# whitelist.js

# build
build  

# test
test

```

**NOTE:** This file contains important information to instruct Git not to add files containing sensitive and confidential information like .env (contains Openai API Key that must never be revealed to others or they will abuse it and useup your API balance via their own app). It will prevent pushing those files to GitHub.

2. Create second file and name it README.md (respect the capitalization) and give a brief description about your AI app for anyone checking the GitHub repository to have understanding of what your codes are about and how to run or use it.

By now your folder in VSCode should look something like this ../ai-chatbot-app :

```javascript
      - ai-chatbot-app "root folder"
          - .gitignore
          - README.md
```

3. Time to commit our update to GitHub.

Open terminal in VSCode and run these commands:

Initialize your Git folder:

```javascript
    git init
```

Then run command to check and ensure the two newly created folders are now listed usually in red indicating they are not added into a commit to prepare them for pushing to GitHub yet:

```javascript
    git status
```

Next, run command to add and prepare for commit:

```javascript
    git add .
```

Next, run command to create a Git commit:

```javascript
    git commit -m "Initial ai chatbot app root folder setup"
```

Next, run command to confirm your folder is linked to the right GitHub repo we cloned earlier:

```javascript
    git remote -v
```

Next, run command to push to GitHub:

```javascript
    git push --set-upstream origin main
```

**NOTE:**
The above `git push --set-upstream origin main` command will help achieve 2 things:

(1) It push your local folder commit to GitHub and

(2) It auto link the main local branch on your PC to the remote version on your GitHUb repo. This ensures that both track each other and inform you which is ahead or behind the other anytime you run `git status` command.

For subsequent push to GitHub you don't need to use the `git push --set-upstream origin main` command again. Just simply use `git push` and it will push successfull to the GitHub repo.

*Finally* run status command again to confirm the above steps done correctly:

```javascript
    git status
```

You should see confirmation that things is uptodate and your local main branch head `origin` is now linked and tracking the remote GitHub main branch `main` as seen in the terminal message below:

```javascript
    On branch main
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

    nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### üé® Exercise 2

Create a new project in Git using Github, clone it to your PC, and set up the project folder in your IDE/Code Editor (VSCode).

#### üçª Challenge 2

Research and implement a version control workflow for your project using Git and Github.

## üîñ Lesson 3: Backend (ExpressJs) With OpenAI API

Backend (ExpressJs)- Connecting to the OpenAI API With ExpressJs

### üîñ 1. Setting up an OpenAi API key

Setting up an API key and endpoint for the OpenAI API

In other to make request to AI models of our choice we need access to Openai's API KEY.

To get that, kindly follow the steps below:

- Register account on Openai APi and get API key at [Openai API](https://openai.com/api?ref=AiHiPUniversity.com "Visit Openai API Website to generate API KEY")

- Once you have your API KEY, copy and paste it somewhere safe and lets move to next step.

***üö©WARNING:***

Your API KEY should not be revealed to anyone or it will be abused and also spend your API balance from unauthorized app. Good news, I have prepared some practical tips to safe guide your API KEY even further under the security section of this course below.

#### üö©Quick Sidenote 1

Before we leave the Openai API website lets play around a bit with the super advanced Large Language AI Models like GTP-3 and others under the `Overview` and `Example` pages.

- When sending prompt to the Openai API will need specify some things like:

The Ai model,

Prompt,

Temperature,

and more as seen here (example code at):

[Openai API Examples](https://beta.openai.com/examples?ref=AiHiPUniversity.com "Visit Openai API Call Examples Website")

- Search `Code` and 

select `Natural language to OpenAI API`

then open in the Openai AI test Playground.

Lets play around first before we choose my prefered model for this course.

Select `code-danvinci-002` `Codex` model

This model powers `Codex` the coding focused AI model trained with huge dataset of opensource codes on platforms like GitHub.

But, have got a even power powerful GTP-3 model for us to checkout and compare the results together.

Give the `Codex`'s `code-danvinci-002` model a coding question

set the `Temperature` to 0 and then later to 1

observe the responses.

Then switch to another model under .

Select `text-danvinci-003` model

set the `Temperature` to 0 and then later to 1

This `text-danvinci-003` GPT3 AI model is the most intelligent and a top large language Ai model from Openai for now as at the time of writing this course material, that may have changed,

To ensure students taking this course are uptodate, have created a section at the end of the course where I plan to be giving update of current Openai model to use for your chatGPT AI chatbot app to ensure you get the best AI responses for your app users.

observe the responses.

and it will be clear to you that even though `Codex` was trained mainly on `codes`, the quality of its output doesn't rival the general purpose natural language text focuse GTP-3 model.

GTP-3 model `test-davinci-003` wins with more quality code output

and ability to follow instructions in natural language and translate it into `code` to enhance `developer`

the same powerful AI model is what `Foskaay` coding AI is been built and experimented on.

- Test the Ai temperature 0 and 1 to see differences in the response given if asked the same questions

- Click on `view code` and here we go

the needed parameter to add up to our Express.js server when making call to Openai API later below.

You may need to change the option from `python` to `node.js`, copy and safe this somewhere.

It should look like or similar to this `javascript` `node.js` and `POST request` API call code:

```javascript

POST /v1/completions
node.js

const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");

const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

const response = await openai.createCompletion({
  model: "text-davinci-003",
  prompt: "\"\"\"\nUtil exposes the following:\nutil.openai() -> authenticates & returns the openai module, which has the following functions:\nopenai.Completion.create(\n    prompt=\"<my prompt>\", # The prompt to start completing from\n    max_tokens=123, # The max number of tokens to generate\n    temperature=1.0 # A measure of randomness\n    echo=True, # Whether to return the prompt in addition to the generated completion\n)\n\"\"\"\nimport util\n\"\"\"\nCreate an OpenAI completion starting from the prompt \"Once upon an AI\", no more than 5 tokens. Does not include the prompt.\n\"\"\"\ncompletion = util.openai().Completion.create(\n    prompt=\"Once upon an AI\",\n    max_tokens=5,\n    echo=False\n)\nprint(completion.choices[0].text)\n\n\n",
  temperature: 0.7,
  max_tokens: 64,
  top_p: 1,
  frequency_penalty: 0,
  presence_penalty: 0,
  stop: ["\"\"\""],
});

```

When using the above, we will adjust and even remove some parameters we don't need to run our own chatbot but feel free to experiment with any of the features even if not used in this course.

yeah next...

### üîñ 2. Setting up ExpressJs Server

It now time to setup our chatGPT-like AI chatbot app backend server with Express.js.

Lets goüî•üöÄ.

Go back to the VSCode and lets continue where we left after creating .`.gitignore` and `README.md` files in the root folder and pushed to GitHub.

#### üöß Create sever folder

***1.*** Create a new folder and name it `server` for Expressjs server to handle API key and API request inside the root folder ../ai-chatbot-app:

By now your folder in VSCode should look something like this ../ai-chatbot-app :

```javascript

      - ai-chatbot-app "root folder"
          - server "backend folder"
          - .gitignore
          - README.md

```

Next step.

#### üöß Inside the server folder

***2.*** Inside server folder, create a `.env` file,

(or rename .env.example to .env if you are using the full repo of this course).

Put the Openai API KEY we created earlier inside the `.env` file following the format below:

(üö© Please, do ensure .gitignore in the root folder prevents commiting your `.env` file publicly to GitHub, to avoid exposing your Openai API kEY to the public).

```javascript
  # COPY AND PAST YOUR OPENAI's API KEY BELOW WITHIN THE QOUTAION MARKS. 
  # WARNING: Your API Key is confidencial and must not be exposed on frontend or commited to public places like Github:
  # To avoid exposing your API key, kindly rename this file from .evn.example to .env to avoid any errors accessing it by the server,
  # and it will also ensure that .gitinore rules help prevent exposing your API KEY by removing it from your commit files to send to github. 

  OPENAI_API_KEY= "COPY AND PASTE TO REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR OPENAI's API KEY"
```

You can close the `.env` file,

and move to next step.

#### üöß Create package.json in server folder

***3.*** Create `package.json` file to manage the server script, dependences and other essential things for the Express.js server to run successfully.

You can not just create this file as usual like previously created files,

instead we will set it up by runing some commands in the VSCode terminal.

- Open the VSCode terminal and go into the server folder `../ai-chatbot-app` by runing the command below:

```javascript
    cd server
```

- By now you should be in `../ai-chatbot-app/server` folder in your VSCode terminal. Then run the command:

```javascript
    pnpm init
```

The above command helps to create the needed `package.json` file

and set it up with essential initial/basic `json object` data and configuration,

so that we don't need to do it manually.

Your default generated `package.json` file may look like this:

```javascript
  {
    "name": "servertest",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC"
  }
```

We will adjust it down the line.

No time to waste time,

Lets keep moving.

#### üöß Install Node Packages in package.json


We are still working on the `package.json` file.

We need to install and setup some essential `Node Packages` in `package.json` in server folder to run the server.

Run command:

```javascript
        pnpm i express dotenv openai nodemon cors
```

The above command `i` represent `install` (you can use either of it will work just fine).

If successfully installed the 5 node packages,

you will see something like this in your VSCode terminal:

```javascript
pnpm i express dotenv openai nodemon cors
‚ÄâWARN‚Äâ GET https://registry.npmjs.org/express error (ECONNRESET). Will retry in 10 seconds. 2 retries left.

##### üö©Quick Sidenote 2

I intentionally did not cut away the update box part of the terminal message above because it doesn't display it always but whenever you are installing or setting up new `node package` with `pnpm` and see  the update box similar to this above `Update available! 7.24.3 ‚Üí 7.25.0.`,

please, don't cancel the current process.

Allow it to install or setup completely.

Imediately after that, run the command:

```javascript
    pnpm add -g pnpm
```

This will ensure you always have the latest recommended version of the `pnpm` node package manager in use.

That aside,

##### üöß Next step

Now back to our just completed node packages installations.

**It helps to install five (5) essential node packages which are:**

***i.*** `express` - the Express.js node package for the AI chatbot backend server setup

***ii.*** `dotenv` - that name should be familiar from previous `.env` file we setup earlier.

It helps to ensure the ExpressJs server can pickup and process the Openai API KEY stored in the `.env` file without actually exposing it to the public. Because without the API KEY added, our request to Openai API endpoint will be outrightly rejected as unauthorized.

***iii.*** `openai` - sounds familiar too. It's a wrapper around Openai API that makes it super easier to make a request to their server and get back Ai responses from the Openai's API with our API KEY.

***iv.*** `nodemon` - hmmm not family maybe, but no worries. 

All that the `nodemon` node package does for us is to ensure that we are able to have the server auto refresh whenever we make new changes and save them. If not, its annoying process to always have to manually stop the backend server, and then restart each time we make changes and save them.

Imaging how it will feel like if we will be making atleast 50 changes and saving it in the process of building the server, then need to manually stop server and restart 50 times.

boring and annoying üí© right - yeeeh a million timesüßê.

As devs we always look for easier way out for boring repititve task 1000% of times‚úÖ.

***v.*** `cors` - this should also be familiar if you have worked with API request before. Its a safety measure and this node package makes it easy for our SvelteKit frontend to connect with the Express.js backend endpoint or its request may be outrightly rejected as well.

***HINT:***

In the security section of this course, I will also show you how to maximize the `cors` node package to tighten the security of the Expressjs backend even further against attackers.

Yeah time to move away from the `package.json` file land üöö and head back to the forest üå±

But before we do, cross check your `package.json` content,

it should be similar to this:

```javascript
  {
    "name": "server",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "dependencies": {
      "cors": "^2.8.5",
      "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
      "express": "^4.18.2",
      "nodemon": "^2.0.20",
      "openai": "^3.1.0"
    }
  }
```

Also,

By now your chatGPT clone AI chatbot folder in VSCode should look something like this ../ai-chatbot-app :

```javascript
      - ai-chatbot-app "root folder"

          - server "backend folder"
                - .env
                - package.json 

          - .gitignore

          - README.md
```

If all set,

we can now proceed.

### üîñ 3. Using ExpressJs to make API Request

Using ExpressJs Post Reqest to make API calls and handle responses to create endpoint for our AI chatbot app frontend.

To achieve this we need to create another file inside the `server` folder

called `server.js`.

This is the actual `Express.js Javascript` file that will help us to make API calls with our API KEY to Openai's API anytime a user send questions in form of request/prompt from the SvelteKit Ai chatbot frontend

And get back AI responses from our Express.js server.

Put the code below inside the `server.js` file,

or watch the video for explaination how it was created.

```javascript

import express from 'express' //backend server framework
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv' // access and use API KEY stored in .env file
import cors from 'cors' //allow make cross origin API request to server from frontend
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai' //Openai API wrapper


//call config function to give access to .env API KEY variable
dotenv.config() 


//Openai API wrapper function which accepts API KEY as object parameter
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});


// create instance of Openai and pass in the configuration object created above
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);


// initialize expressjs server
const app = express()


// configure the cors middleware to allow accepting and processing request from allowed domains
app.use(cors());


//middleware: allows the backend to recieve and acces request from frontend as a json object
// rather than just a string. 
// This is necessary in the following POST request route code: 
// app.post('/', async (req, res) => {
// try {const prompt = req.body.prompt; 
// where it uses req.body to get the prompt data/question sent in the post request
// from our chatGPT Ai chatBot SvelteKit powered frontend
app.use(express.json())


// routes/endpoint to expose expressjs backend to frontend "GET" request
// with a return statement of info to show user visiting the route
app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send({
    message: 'Hello Web3 AI World from Foskaay AI',
  })
})


//route/endpoint which allows Expressjs backend to recieve and process
// the request sent from users of our chatGPT Ai chatBot SvelteKit powered frontend
app.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  
  try {
    const prompt = req.body.prompt; //access user question submited as prompt

    //Initiate an API call to Openai's API to recieve response for user questions 
    //from Openai's AI
    // But while making the call we bundle the user question/prompt and other
    // instructions to ensure we get the best response from the AI back to user
    const response = await openai.createCompletion({
      model: "text-davinci-002", //most powerful openai large language Ai model for now
      prompt: `${prompt}`, //input text value of the form input box in sveltekit app ui
      temperature: 1, // Higher values means the model will take more risks and can change/modify response for same question when asked again.
      max_tokens: 3000, // If not specified, it auto limit reponses usually less than 50 character (thats about 50 words)The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support over 8,000).
      top_p: 1, // alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling
      frequency_penalty: 0.5, // Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
      presence_penalty: 0, // Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
      // user: "user123456", // optional but can be useful to detect user abusing your API request. You can use session ID or hash email/psw so each user is unique but still not individually identificable for openai
    });

    //Send the AI response back to user of 
    // our chatGPT Ai chatBot SvelteKit powered frontend 
    //in json format with a success status code of 200. 
    res.status(200).send({
      ai: response.data.choices[0].text
    });


    // logs error to the console and sends it back our chatGPT Ai chatBot SvelteKit powered frontend
    //with a status of 500 if there is any error caught in try block.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    res.status(500).send(error || 'Something went wrong communicating with Ai Foskaay');
  }
})


// start the server on specified port on localhost
// this get overriden when deployed to web server by the server url
// "started on http://localhost:5001" makes the port link clickable from terminal
app.listen(5001, () => console.log('Foskaay Ai server started on http://localhost:5001'))

```

#### üö©Quick Sidenote 3

Now that we have moved to coding aspect,

just a reminder to always comment your code even before you write it or alteast before you leave it for other codes.

Incase you are too lazy to write code comments when coding (don't know why thoughüôà),

then you can feed your code into coding AI under the recommended AI coding tools above at the top of this course,

ask the coding Ai you decide to use, to explain the code and when you are convinced and satisfied that it understood what the code does.

Simply tell it to add comments to the code and send it back.

Gbamüí• you done with a well commented code without writting a single line of comment yourself.

What a lazyüèóÔ∏è way to be a developer - but anyways its AI world - ENJOYü§°!

#### üîñ Back to our server.js file

A brief summary of the `server.js` above.

It already self explainatory enough based on been a well commented code

yet here is a summary of what the code does:

Import all the 5 `node packages` we installed previously

initialize and use them

use `middleware` in Express.js to access some functions of the installed packages like `cors` (cross origin)

Then create a GET route and POST route, the post route is used to bundle user request in `input` box in the chatGPT AI chatbot SvelteKit app UI.

package it with other essential configuration like the API KEY in `.env` file to access GPT-3 AI and await the response.

Once the GTP-3 AI responds, forward the response to the frontend

and if not response due to error, also inform user in the frontend about the unsuccessful request to the AI.

next please....

### üîñ 4. Creating API Endpoint for SveltKit Frontend

Creating an API endpoint for Frontend to access the AI chatbot's responses from Openai API

We have already create the endpoint for our frontend to access from above code.

Since we are still going to test this on local server temporarity

untill both backend and frontend are working.

this code in the last part of our server.js file will help create the needed local server via `localhost` specified `port` below:

```javascript

// start the server on specified port on localhost
// this get overriden when deployed to web server by the server url
app.listen(5001, () => console.log('Foskaay Ai server started on http://localhost:5001'))

```

Yeah, good job

You have come this far

let keep moving until goalü•Ö of a chatGPT clone AI chatbot app 

is achieved

### üîñ 5. Run Server to Test ExpressJs Backend

Testing the ExpressJs backend by runing the server

Yeah, its time to test our backend Express.js server

But, before we do that,

there is need to do some cleanup in the `package.json` file

or else it will likely output error and server will not run smoothly as expected.

```javascript

{
  "name": "foskaay-ai-server",
  "private": true,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "server": "nodemon server"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.20",
    "openai": "^3.1.0"
  }
}

```

- You will notice some adjustment compared to the previous object data in the `package.json` file as follows:

`"name":` changed (can be name of choice)

`"version":` unchanged (can be number of choice)

`"description":` removed (since its empty)

`"main": "index.js",` removed (it may cause confusing on which file to run when starting the server)

 `"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"` inside `"scripts"` removed and was replaced with `"server": "nodemon server"` because we are not runing the test script,

 instead, remember the `nodemon` node package we installed earlier,

 this is where it is been used to ensure it monitors the `server.js` file for any saved changes. Stops and automatically restarts the server to ensure we don't have to do that stressful üí© manually each time.

 remeber to change the `nodemon server` to whatever if you decide to name your `server.js` any other thing.

 let say you name your `server.js` as `index.js` or `appserver.js`

 you also need to rename `"server": "nodemon server"` to `"server": "nodemon index"`

 or `"server": "nodemon appserver"` or whatever.

- other things like `"keywords": [], "author": "",` and `"license": "ISC",`

 were removed (it totally optional)

- While some new key value peer were included to the `package.json` object:

 `"private": true,` and `"type": "module",` - what do they do? why are they added? Are they essential or optional?

Sincerely before now am not sure but I did ask one of the AI I recommended above as your coding support AI and here comes the answer from ChatGPT about the code and full breakdown of the `package.json` file:

#### üìù My Coding Question to ChatGPT AI

```javascript

this is the package.json file for the expressjs server file complete code sent earlier. can you explain what each of this key value pair does in the code:
{
  "name": "foskaay-ai-server",
  "private": true,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "server": "nodemon server2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.20",
    "openai": "^3.1.0"
  }
}

```

#### ‚úÖ ChatGPT Response to my code

```javascript

"name": "foskaay-ai-server" is the name of the project, it can be any name of your choice
"private": true means this package won't accidentally be published to npm, it's intended for use as a dependency of other projects or for local development only.
"version": "1.0.0" is the version of the package. This can be updated as the package is updated and changed.
"type": "module" indicates that the package contains ECMAScript modules.
"scripts" is an object that contains commands that can be run with npm. In this case, the "server": "nodemon server2" command runs the server file using nodemon package and server2 is the file name.
"dependencies" is an object that lists the package dependencies of the project. These packages are required for the project to run and are automatically installed when you run npm install. In this case, the dependencies are:
"cors": "^2.8.5" is used to configure cross-origin resource sharing in the Express app.
"dotenv": "^16.0.3" is used to load environment variables from a .env file.
"express": "^4.18.2" is the Express.js framework used to create the server.
"nodemon": "^2.0.20" is used to automatically restart the server when changes are made to the code.
"openai": "^3.1.0" is a package that provides a simple API for interacting with the OpenAI API.
Please note that the version numbers may change with updates.

```

Hurray, atleast if I know nothing,

I have different coding AI buddy that always come to my resque before you launghüì∏ at me - yeah i can seeüßê you did when i said that i didn't know what the added code do in server easier.

Cool,

time to testrun the server

are you ready?

Yeah 101% excited.

#### ‚öóÔ∏è Testing the Express.js backend server

May its just an experiment‚öóÔ∏è or a working code

Its time to test and validate things for real

Incase you have forgotten, let me remind you that your VSCode trminal should still remain open (if closed time to re-open it)

Click the `+` icon to create to instance of the terminal in VScode

the first terminal lets call it `terminal 1`

go into the server folder by runing command:

```javascript
      cd server
```

then when sure your terminal is at `../ai-chatbot-app/server`,

run command:

```javascript
      pnpm run server
```

if all goes fine,

you should see this in your VSCode terminal:

```javascript

$ pnpm run server

> foskaay-ai-server@1.0.0 server ../ai-chatbot-app/server
> nodemon server

[nodemon] 2.0.20
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node server2.js`
Foskaay Ai server started on http://localhost:5001

```

Meanwhile,

By now your chatGPT clone AI chatbot folder in VSCode should look something like this ../ai-chatbot-app :

```javascript
      - ai-chatbot-app "root folder"

          - server "backend folder"
                - .env
                - package.json 
                - server.js "Express.js server with API call, Post/Get routes"

          - .gitignore

          - README.md
```


### üîñ Exercise 3

Implement the API calls and handle the responses and test the endpoint with your name as the custom response on the get request. Screenshot and add to your exercises repo for submition.

#### üçª Challenge 3

 Push your code to GitHub, with a commit message that says:

"I, Your Full Name setup Server for my ChatGPT AI ChatBot App Powered by Openai GPT-3 AI API via AiHiPUniversity Free Advanced Developer Course"

NOTE: Change `Your Full Name` to your actual Full Name that will be on your Certificate for this course.

And submit for check before you move on to other stages.

üö©Reminder to always commit and pust to your project GitHub repo after minor or major changes

## üîíÔ∏è Lesson 5: Adding Security Features to AI ChatBot

Adding Security Features to AI ChatBot Website

As it is now lets try it, anyone using the Ai chatbot app frontend can easy use `inspect tool` in browsers like Chrome, Firefox and more to see our Express.js backend endpoint url

though it looks harmless until you think deeply and ask yourself this question I asked myself after developing to this point.

What if someone get the backend endpoint url, and just use it in their on chatbots, how will my backend or openai different that the API call isn't actually from me?

hmmm scary

Yeah - anyone at this point can hook up to our backend server and use it to abuse our Openai API and even exhaust all our API balance in our Openai API account.

Painful right?

Yeah, but all hope not lost,

In my quest for solution

I turned to my coding AI buddies and personal porgramming assitants

They spit out different solutions but 

I was pleased with just 2 because that was what I had in mind but at that point didn't just know how to implement it with code

It simple,

I got the idea from my experience with Google API platforms years ago

When I do use Google API, they have a place i can list allowed domains

what this does it to ensure even if someone get access to my API KEY,

and attempt to make API request to Google API server from their own app

Google will say yes, I see you have the correct API but you are making request from a domain I don't know (means not added to the allow list)

Google server will outrightly reject the request as unauthorized

What this meant is that for an hacker or anyone to successfully use my Google API key, they also need to compromide my website and be making the request directly from my website and domain.

Anything outside that will not be process by Google API endpoint.

I even tweeted at Openai official handle to consider adding such helpsul security layer to their API platform. Got no response to my tweet

So, I decided to retry and solve things myself
afterall thats while am a developer right - solving problems is my hubby as a dev.

Cool, as mentioned earlier, I explained same to my AI coding friends and viola

the same could be implemented without the help of Openai and things will be much secured as long as I do not expose my Openai API KEY (since they have not implemented this at their own end, its not secure to have your API leak to Public. if it ever happens. once you are aware, go to your Openai API dashboard, revoke and generate a new API KEY instantly without further delay)

but as long as your API KEY not leaked,

then this method is safe even if your Express.js POST request API endpoint is visible in your frontend like we have now

Anyone that pick it must also make call to your AI chatbot Express.js backend not just with the endpoint url but also from your website/domain or any other domains you allow.

if not it will be percieved as unauthorized request and instantly and outrightly rejected.

Cool.

So, lets adjust our `server` folder and `server.js` file to implement this 2 layer security features.
