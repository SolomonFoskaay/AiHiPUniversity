## üìù Become A Successful Developer

Master essential attitudes to become a lifetime successful developer:

i. Embrace Ai like Foskaay Ai for coding and programming support always (before, during and after launching your project)

ii. Security (Ai can help discover and patch security flaws in your project early before and during launching)

iii. Start every project with Git Private (start with Opensource as beginner dev, close source only when become pro dev if essential for funding & IP protection)

iv. Code Commenting

v. Simplicity wins over complication/complexity (functions getting complex, break to simpler ones)

vi. Leave local host quicker for Production Deployment and testing.

vii. Listen to your project users feedbacks and tinker adjustment fast bit-by-bit

viii. Keep the programming spirit high and alive by doing good to humanity and nature with your coding/progamming skill and not evil.
