			and down arrows

		13. Use NFT to unlock the AI chatBot app (Web3 integration)

		14. Some modern user experience features you could 
			add to your AI chatbot include:

			i. Conversational context: keep track of the conversation's context to
			 		understand the user's intent, for example: 
				The user had been asking about the weather and the next query
					 if the user says "what about tomorrow", 
				Your chatbot should be able to understand that the user is still 
					asking about the weather.
				Here is a sample code snippet that you can use to implement
				 context in your Chatbot:

				Copy code
				// A context object to keep track of conversation context
				let context = {};

				// Update the context object based on the user's message
				function updateContext(message) {
				// Assume the user is asking for the weather
				context.topic = 'weather';
				// Extract the location from the message
				const locationRegex = /(?:in|for|near|at) ([\w\s]+)/i;
				const match = message.match(locationRegex);
				if (match) {
				context.location = match[1];
				}
				}

				// use this on your onSubmit function before calling the api
				updateContext(message);

				// pass context object on the fetch request to save context
				const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000', {
				method: 'POST',
				headers: {
					'Content-Type': 'application/json',
				}, 
				body: JSON.stringify({ prompt: message, context }),
				});                

			ii. Multimodal input: support different ways of receiving user input,
				 for example: voice, text, and touch.

			iii. Adaptive learning: allow the chatbot to learn from user
			 	interactions and improve over time.

			iv. Personalization: allow the user to set preferences and personalize
				 the experience, for example: the chatbot could greet the user
				  by name and ask how they're doing.

			v. Multi-Language support: allow the user to switch between 
				different languages.

#### üçª Challenge 1

Research and apply best practices for building an AI Chatbot.

## üé® Lesson 2: Setup Project with Git

You need to first setup the project on GitHub (this might be contrary to what you are used to doing as a developer. Yeah, I want to help you adopt the good habit of consistently commiting your work to Git server like GitHub).

Incase anything happens to your PC during your project development phase, you are sure of having a backup to recover your project on GitHub.

### üé® 1. Create Project in Git using Github

Create an empty folder on GitHub named ai-chatbot-app.

**NOTE:**

i. Don't initialize it with README.md file, just leave empty.

ii. You can also make it Private repo and later turn it to public repo under the repo setting page when your AI chatbot app is ready for deployment on web server.

### üé® 2. Clone GitHub Repo to PC

Clone the empty folder from GitHub to your PC.

Open your terminal and inside the folder you want the project to be, run:

```javascript
    git clone the-url-of-your-github-repo-here
```

Then, run:

```javascript
      cd ai-chatbot-app
```

Once sure that you are in the cloned repo folder (../course-demo/ai-chatbot-app), run:

```javascript
      code .
```      

This will open the cloned empty ai-chatbot-app folder in VSCode editor.

That is where we will be bringing our app to life step by step.

### üé® 3. Setting up Project Folder in IDE(VSCode)

Setting up Project Folder in IDE/Code Editor (VSCode)

If everything goes fine, you should have an empty ai-chatbot-app folder now opened in VSCode editor.

It is time to begin creating essential folders and files for the app.

Before setting up the server folder which is the next thing to do. Lets quickly setup two (2) important files in the empty root folder ../ai-chatbot-app as follows:

1. Create a .gitignore file with following content:

```js
# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
pnpm-debug.log*
lerna-debug.log*

node_modules
dist
dist-ssr
*.local

# Editor directories and files
.vscode/*
!.vscode/extensions.json
.idea
.DS_Store
*.suo
*.ntvs*
*.njsproj
*.sln
*.sw?

# env
.env

# others:
# whitelist.js

# build
build  

# test
test

```

**NOTE:** This file contains important information to instruct Git not to add files containing sensitive and confidential information like .env (contains Openai API Key that must never be revealed to others or they will abuse it and useup your API balance via their own app). It will prevent pushing those files to GitHub.

2. Create second file and name it README.md (respect the capitalization) and give a brief description about your AI app for anyone checking the GitHub repository to have understanding of what your codes are about and how to run or use it.

By now your folder in VSCode should look something like this ../ai-chatbot-app :

```javascript
      - ai-chatbot-app "root folder"
          - .gitignore
          - README.md
```

3. Time to commit our update to GitHub.

Open terminal in VSCode and run these commands:

Initialize your Git folder:

```javascript
    git init
```

Then run command to check and ensure the two newly created folders are now listed usually in red indicating they are not added into a commit to prepare them for pushing to GitHub yet:

```javascript
    git status
```

Next, run command to add and prepare for commit:

```javascript
    git add .
```

Next, run command to create a Git commit:

```javascript
    git commit -m "Initial ai chatbot app root folder setup"
```

Next, run command to confirm your folder is linked to the right GitHub repo we cloned earlier:

```javascript
    git remote -v
```

Next, run command to push to GitHub:

```javascript
    git push --set-upstream origin main
```

**NOTE:**
The above `git push --set-upstream origin main` command will help achieve 2 things:

(1) It push your local folder commit to GitHub and

(2) It auto link the main local branch on your PC to the remote version on your GitHUb repo. This ensures that both track each other and inform you which is ahead or behind the other anytime you run `git status` command.

For subsequent push to GitHub you don't need to use the `git push --set-upstream origin main` command again. Just simply use `git push` and it will push successfull to the GitHub repo.

*Finally* run status command again to confirm the above steps done correctly:

```javascript
    git status
```

You should see confirmation that things is uptodate and your local main branch head `origin` is now linked and tracking the remote GitHub main branch `main` as seen in the terminal message below:

```javascript
    On branch main
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

    nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### üé® Exercise 2

Create a new project in Git using Github, clone it to your PC, and set up the project folder in your IDE/Code Editor (VSCode).

#### üçª Challenge 2

Research and implement a version control workflow for your project using Git and Github.

## üîñ Lesson 3: Backend (ExpressJs) With OpenAI API

Backend (ExpressJs)- Connecting to the OpenAI API With ExpressJs

### üîñ 1. Setting up an OpenAi API key

Setting up an API key and endpoint for the OpenAI API

In other to make request to AI models of our choice we need access to Openai's API KEY.

To get that, kindly follow the steps below:

- Register account on Openai APi and get API key at [Openai API](https://openai.com/api?ref=AiHiPUniversity.com "Visit Openai API Website to generate API KEY")

- Once you have your API KEY, copy and paste it somewhere safe and lets move to next step.

***üö©WARNING:***

Your API KEY should not be revealed to anyone or it will be abused and also spend your API balance from unauthorized app. Good news, I have prepared some practical tips to safe guide your API KEY even further under the security section of this course below.

### üîñ 2. Setting up ExpressJs Server

It now time to setup our chatGPT-like AI chatbot app backend server with Express.js. 

Lets goüî•üöÄ.

Go back to the VSCode and lets continue where we left after creating .`.gitignore` and `README.md` files in the root folder and pushed to GitHub.

***1.*** Create a new folder 1 (server) for Expressjs server to handle API key and API request) inside the root folder named "server" ../ai-chatbot-app:

By now your folder in VSCode should look something like this ../ai-chatbot-app :

```javascript
      - ai-chatbot-app "root folder"
          - server "backend folder"
          - .gitignore
          - README.md
```

***2.*** Inside server folder, create a `.env` file (or rename .env.example to .env if you are using the full repo of this course) and put the Openai API KEY we created earlier in side following the format below (do ensure .gitignore in the root folder prevent commiting your .env file to avoid exposing your Openai API kEY to the public").

```javascript
  # COPY AND PAST YOUR OPENAI's API KEY BELOW WITHIN THE QOUTAION MARKS. 
  # WARNING: Your API Key is confidencial and must not be exposed on frontend or commited to public places like Github:
  # To avoid exposing your API key, kindly rename this file from .evn.example to .env to avoid any errors accessing it by the server,
  # and it will also ensure that .gitinore rules help prevent exposing your API KEY by removing it from your commit files to send to github. 

  OPENAI_API_KEY= "COPY AND PASTE TO REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR OPENAI's API KEY"
```

You can close the .env file and move to next step.

***3.*** Create `package.json` file to manage the server script, dependences and other essential things for the Express.js server to run successfully.

You can't just create this file as usual, instead we will set it up by runing some commands in the VSCode terminal.

- Open the VSCode terminal and go into the server folder `../ai-chatbot-app` by runing the command below:

```javascript
    cd server
```

- By now you should be in `../ai-chatbot-app/server` folder in your VSCode terminal. Then run the command:

```javascript
    pnpm init
```

The above command helps to create the needed `package.json` file and set it up with essential initial/basic `json object` data and configuration so that we don't need to do it manually.

- Still working on the `package.json` file. We need to setup some essential node packages to run the server. Run command:

```javascript
        pnpm i express dotenv openai nodemon cors
```

The above command `i` represent `install` (you can use either of it will work just fine) helps to install five (5) essential node packages which are:

***i.*** `express` - the Express.js node package

***ii.*** `dotenv` - that name should be familiar from previous `.env` file we setup earlier. It helps to ensure the ExpressJs server can pickup and process the Openai API KEY stored in the `.env` file without actually exposing it to the public. Because without the API KEY added, our request to Openai API endpoint will be outrightly rejected as unauthorized.

***iii.*** `openai` - sounds familiar too. It's a wrapper around Openai API that makes it super easier to make a request to their server and get back Ai responses from the Openai's API with our API KEY.

***iv.*** `nodemon` - hmmm not family maybe, but no worries. All that this node package does for us is to ensure that we are able to have the server auto refresh whenever we make new changes and save them. If not, its annoying process to always have to manually stop the backend server, and then restart each time we make changes and save them.

Imaging how it will feel like if we will be making atleast 30 changes and saving it, then need to manually stop server and restart 30 times. boring and annoying right - yeeeh a million time.

As devs we always look for easier way out for boring repititve task 1000% of time.

***v.*** `cors` - this should also be familiar if you have worked with API request before. Its a safety measure and this node package makes it easy for our SvelteKit frontend to connect with the Express.js backend endpoint or its request may be outrightly rejected as well.

***HINT:***

In the security section of this course, I will also show you how to maximize the `cors` node package to tighten the security of the Expressjs backend even further against attackers.

Yeah time to move away from the `package,json` land and head back to the forest
